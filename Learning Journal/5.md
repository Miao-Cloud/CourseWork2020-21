This is a day late, however it is here. So yesterday I managed to create a first person camera object which moves and responds to gravity.
This caused many problems and made it so I had to start over at one point. The camera movement went smoothly, as did the movement and falling. Problems arose when adding a ground check, when added the character no longer responded to gravity. The problem is still unknown to me but this did cause me to backtrack to the beginning of the movement script. re doing it seemed to solve whatever problem there was.
