Today I created ahealth/life counter tutorial. Ran into several hinderences. first being the actual tutorial. At first it was going to be disapearing platforms however I still haven't managed to wrap my head around it, therefore switched to something I already knew and took a slow pace.

The health/life counter itself showed a few issues, however they were all simple fixes such as spelling mistakes and me trying to figure out how to format text withing the tutorial itself.
