This week felt like an absolute disaster. Projects going kaput, to models I spend weeks on not working. Textures not working and builds saying no. Overall it was chaos. I had finished making the basic mechanics for my game which said no when in building phase which ment I had to scrap up another temp project just to show I had done something.

Temp built, gave work in, now I can focus on the desktop cat for a bit.
