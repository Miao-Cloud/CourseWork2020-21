Today I finished making another tutorial. This one was on how to make an object follow a cursor. As simple as it was, I still ran into problems such as spelling and forgetting to add ending } that I may have deleted and ; at the end of each line.

Although I don't particularly like coding, I found making these tutorials quite fun and can see how I can find these useful at a later date with my terrible memory.
