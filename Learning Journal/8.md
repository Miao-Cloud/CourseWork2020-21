This week I had created a collecting system using unity UI system. It turned out to be a sucsess, however with my desktop cat project progress seems rather slow.

I had multiple ideas for the cat, however non are seeming to be possiable. Or at least I am looking in the wrong places. As of now all it does is follow the mouse slowly.
