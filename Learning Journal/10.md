These have all been quite short. I'm never too sure what to write. My programming experiences have not been rather entertaining, everything seems rather straight forward. I have completed the last part of a multitude of codes which work together. Next week I might add a few player movements.

Overall, I haven't been coding each week as I've been working on my disitation.
