Name it enemy.
Give it a colour if it is a unity shape.
Give it a ridgid body.

2. Duplicate the object twice or drag in two more different enemy srpites.

Change the colours of the two new duplicates.
You can create a prefabs folder and drag in the 3 enemies.
Delete them from the hierarchy if they're there.

3. Now to create a spawner, rightclick in the hierarchy and create an empty gameobject.

Rename it to Random Enemy Spawner.
Right click your Random Enemy Spawner and click create empty.
In the inspector, next to the name if the object, click on the box.
Click on a coloured circle.
